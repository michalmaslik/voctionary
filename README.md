# Voctionary

**Voctionary** is a language-learning application focused on building and expanding vocabulary. The project is structured into three main parts:

---

## 📦 `voctionary-springboot` (Backend)

This is the **backend** component of the application, built with Spring Boot (Java).  
It is responsible for:
- processing data and serving the API,
- handling user authentication and authorization,
- communicating with the database,
- managing requests from the frontend and browser extension...

---

## 🌐 `voctionary-frontend` (Frontend)

This is the **frontend** – the user-facing web interface (built with React).  
It handles:
- displaying vocabulary, exercises, user progress...
- user registration and login,
- interacting with the backend via API...

## 🧩 `voctionary-extension` (Browser Extension)

This is the **browser extension** (e.g. for Chrome or Firefox) that:
- allows users to translate and save words directly from websites,
- connects to the backend to store vocabulary,
- makes learning easy and accessible while browsing the web...

### ⚠️ Note

This project is no longer maintained and is provided for reference purposes only.
It was developed as a personal project and serves as a showcase of my code and work.
Since it relies on external APIs, some features may no longer work as expected, and the deployment is currently inactive.
